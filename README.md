# Ecommerce_Data_Analysis_using_SQL-Python


This project is a comprehensive data analysis of an e-commerce dataset using **MySQL** for querying and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for visualization. The goal is to extract actionable insights from raw transactional data — ideal for developing business strategies, customer segmentation, and retention analysis.
